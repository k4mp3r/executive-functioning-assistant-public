# Executive Functioning Assistant Process and Design

## Standing Personal Agreements

- Limit major changes to this system to a monthly basis
  - This provides time to truly test a process
  - Limits time spent on over optimization
  - Builds resilience
  - Promotes development of internalized mindfulness loop.

## Process

### Daily

    subgraph Daily Apple Reminders
        A[Notification Received] --> B{Able to\ncomplete\ntask?}
        B -->|Yes| C[Complete task]
        B -->|No| D[Leave Task Uncompleted]
    end
    subgraph Weekly Audit
        C & D --> E[Begin]
        E --> F{Any\npast due\ntasks?}
        F -->|Yes| G[Complete outstanding tasks.\nReset recurring tasks that were time sensitive.]

        H --> I{efa patch\nneeded?}
        I -->|Yes| J[Patch efa if needed]
        I -->|No| K[Add efa enhancement issue for monthly review]
        F -->|No| M[Relax]
    end
```

- There are many daily reminders
- Some are individual tasks and other are triggers to start checklists.
- The reminders are set at a frequency where if for whatever reason, the task is not completed, it will show as overdue until it is due again.
- If the natural cycle doesn't pick it up, the weekly retro and weekly audit are designed as a safety net.

### Weekly

#### *Friday evening*

    subgraph Retro
        A1[Notification Received] --> B1[Review how well the week aligned with the intention set]
        B1 --> C1{Action Items?}
        C1 -->|Yes| D1{efa patch\nneeded?}
        D1 -->|Yes| E1[Patch efa if needed]
        D1 -->|No| F1[Add efa enhancement issue for monthly review]
    end
    subgraph Task Migration

        B2 --> C2{open tasks?}
        C2 -->|No| D2[Complete Apple reminder task]
        C2 -->|Yes| E2{Can the task\nbe completed now?}
        E2 -->|Yes| F2[Complete bujo task]
        E2 -->|No| G2[Migrate the task to GitHub issue]
    end
    H2[Set intention for next week.]
```

- Task Migration - identify all uncompleted tasks then either:
  - Do the task
  - Convert the task into a github issue for the appropriate project
  - Add the task to google calendar
  - Add the task to apple reminders with the correct due date
  - Cancel the task
- Retrospective
  - Review how well the week went compared to the intention set.
  - Identify what went well
    - Low anxiety
    - Accomplishments
    - Positive interpersonal relationships
    - etc
  - Identify what didn't go well and determine if there are lifestyle changes needed.
    - Missed or late appointments or meetings
    - Over spending
    - Anxiety or depression
    - etc
  - Record any EFA process changes into the efa gh project.
- Intention setting
  - What is the focus for next week?
  - Keep it focused on desired outcomes rather than specific actions.

#### *Sunday evening*

    I -->|Yes| J[Patch efa if needed]
    I -->|No| K[Add efa enhancement issue for monthly review]
    F -->|No| M[Update Template]
    M --> G
```

- Verify GitHub weekly audit template is current
  - Update if needed.
- Create new GitHub issue for the week
- Follow the checklist in the issue
  - Verify I haven't forgotten to follow the efa process and to update tools if I have forgotten.
  - This also has a side effect of building trust in my process when I review and see that everything is working.
- Introduce small patch changes to this process if needed.
- Capture efa enhancements with GitHub issue in this repo tagged with `enhancement`

### Monthly

    I -->|No| K[Publish major version and update public facing repo]
    F -->|No| M[Update Template]
    M --> G
    J --> K
```

- Retro on EFA process and make adjustments based on finds recorded in efa project issues
- Update this document to reflect process changes.
- Add additional month of entries to bujo
- Create new version release in github
- Update public facing repo to share with others.

### Quarterly and Yearly

Same process at monthly at this point.

## Known Gaps And Limitations

Why you might not want to adopt this yet.

### Task Execution

The current design phase is focused on only capturing and raising awareness of what I currently have going on. I have not yet designed the system and process for prioritizing and scheduling tasks. That should be coming up soon and I will be exploring that in June 2023. So the current system will help you become aware of all the things you are not doing which can be a source of anxiety.

### Cumbersome

The current process is time consuming as I am still in the design and implement phase so there is a lot of heavy lifting with documentation and trying to establish new routines. This will get faster as I start moving these tasks from working memory to habitual behavior. Once project the shifts from design and development to maintenance this burden should be reduced.

## Tools & Configurations

### [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/) (BuJo)

- purpose
  - is the field note and task tracker.
  - This works well for situations where phone or laptop use would not be socially appropriate and to minimize distractions.
- configuration
  - I keep the BuJo at a weekly scale and no more. Anything longer out than that should be tracked in a tool with automated reminders
  - Each "section" is given an entire page to build out a planner style
  - Weeks end on Friday nights
  - Each week has a the following sections in this order:
    - Weekly Retro | The Week's Goals (on same page)
    - Daily Entry (Saturday - Friday)

### Apple Reminders

- purpose
  - used for recurring reminders and rapid notes
- configuration
  - All reminders must have a due date
  - Recurring reminders should be tagged with a frequency indicator so they can appear on a `smart list` to quickly reference what active reminders are present.
  - efa reminder list used for capturing rapid notes when bujo is not available, always set a reminder.
  - A `smart list` showing tasks with no due date or location trigger should be created to assist with audit process.
  - Current Reminders:
    - Daily:
      - PT Exercises: 6:50a
      - EFA - BuJo / GH project Morning Review: 7:15a
      - 10mg: 8a
      - Have courage to be disliked: 8:44a
      - EFA - BuJo Mid-Day Review: 12p
      - PT Exercises: 12p
      - 10mg: 12p

### Google Calendar

- purpose
  - with notifications is used for tracking meetings and appointments.
- configuration
  - All future events, single or recurring, should be added to Google Calendar.
  - Each event should have automated reminders that fire when action should be taken.
  - Email, SMS, and Push notifications should be enabled
  - Work events do not need to be on personal calendars.
  - Personal events occurring during work hours should be added to work calendars.

    - Issues are sized and prioritized
  - project
    - GitHub project with tabs of each repo should be created
    - Tab called inbox should be configured for issues in this repo with the tag `inbox`
    - Tabs to list issues by priority and by size should be created to help with grooming and audit process

### Apple Watch

- purpose
  - is used for minimalist reminder notification, tracking health, and quick voice memos.
- configuration
  - Configured to receive push notifications from iPhone
  - Disable alarm notifications (alarms related to sleep cannot be disabled)
