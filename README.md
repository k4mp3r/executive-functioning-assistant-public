# executive-functioning-assistant-public
The public facing side of my EFA project that can be used as a template or forked for your own ADHD management system.

I am currently migrating over information from my private repo as I build things out and start finding success. The core file of this repo to watch is the [executive functioning process](executive-functioning-process.md). This project is my personal attempt at creating a system to function as an executive functioning prosthetic for individuals with ADHD. This is especially challenging as individuals with ADHD tend to forget they even have a system.

Update Frequency: estimating every 4-6 weeks, will use versioning that matches my private repo for referencing.
